# Plug-in Workflow Step Packages

This repository contains plug-in workflow step packages.

These packages can be used in Embotics Commander workflow extension scenarios. Some of these packages can also be used outside Embotics  scenarios.

You can find the files required for scenarios in the [Scenarios repository](https://github.com/Embotics/Scenarios). Complete scenario documentation is available on the [Embotics Support Knowledge Base](https://support.embotics.com/support/home).

The README file for each plug-in indicates the Commander versions that are compatibility with that plug-in.

See [Adding plug-in workflow steps](http://docs.embotics.com/vCommander/Using-Plug-In-WF-Steps.htm#Adding) in the Commander documentation to learn how to install plug-in step packages.
